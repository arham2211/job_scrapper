About you
You understand the research management ecosystem and how universities and health services actually get work done.

You’ve worked across multiple stakeholder groups and are comfortable balancing day‑to‑day matters with the dynamics of multiple streams of project delivery. Whether your path has been operational within a research intensive organisation or product/delivery for a vendor you will bring credibility with research management professionals and the judgement to lead a team that’s close to clients and outcomes.

A track record delivering or supporting business systems, ideally SaaS.
Strength in stakeholder engagement across academic, professional, and IT groups, with clear, plain‑language communication.
Comfort moving between detail and big picture: from root‑cause analysis and SOPs to roadmap, prioritisation, and acceptance.
Team leadership that’s low‑ego, collaborative, and oriented to service quality and measurable client outcomes.
