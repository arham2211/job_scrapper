To open our
first interstate campus in Brisbane, Queensland
and build a premium education experience that reshapes how students learn, and that parents rave about?
To take a proven Victorian playbook and execute it so well in Brisbane that it becomes the benchmark for our national expansion?
At Contour, we're searching for a
builder-operator
. A leader who lives and breathes high standards, loves the craft of scaling operations, and can turn a brand-new campus into a beautiful, seamless, and impactful learning space.
If the idea of planting the Contour flag in Queensland and scaling to multiple campuses lights you up, keep reading...
Starting in
2026
, Contour is expanding beyond our 8 campuses in Victoria to
Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia
.
As Area Manager – Brisbane, you’ll be the lead operator for Brisbane. You'll open up our first campus, recruit and develop the service team, run flawless day-to-day campus operations, and set a standard that becomes indistinguishable from our best Melbourne sites.
This isn't a ""maintenance mode"" role. It's launch, lead, and continuously raise the bar. And your opportunity to make a tangible impact, grow as a leader, and pioneer the Queensland arm of reshaping education on a national scale.
Who We Are
At Contour, we’re reshaping education, one student at a time.
Born from the frustration of students who knew the system could be better, we set out to build what we once wished existed: tutoring that actually works. Not generic classes. Not recycled notes. Not overpriced, overcrowded rooms with an out-of-touch teacher who couldn’t relate. But a complete ecosystem of tutoring, resources, and support, meticulously designed to help every student reach their full potential.
Since 2020, over 10,000+ students have trusted Contour to guide their academic journey, and we’ve grown to over 300+ team members. We’ve produced hundreds of 99+ ATARs, tutored the World-Record UCAT scorer, and placed more students into medical school than any school in Australia.
Our growth is a testament to the simple philosophy: Put the student first, always. Everything we design, from our world-class tutor-training programs to our purpose-built campuses, exists to help students master content faster, perform with confidence, and even rekindle the joy of learning.
Contour is a group of three brands united by one goal: to give every student the best chance to achieve their full potential:
Contour Education:
Reshaping how students master their high school subjects with small-group tutoring, structured resources, and 1-on-1 support across Maths, Science, and English.
Contour Medprep:
Reshaping medical preparation with a proven, step-by-step pathway through the UCAT, interviews, and admissions, led by a team of 100+ medical students.
Contour TestPrep:
Reshaping test preparation, starting with the selective entry exam, through rigorous tutoring, mock exams, and data-driven feedback to give students a decisive advantage.
This is Contour. Built by students, for students.
What You Will Do

People leader: recruits well, coaches hard and kind, builds capability and pride.
Operator’s eye: you notice the 1% details (chairs straight, print packs perfect, lighting right) and the 10,000-foot flows (schedules, staffing, cost lines).
System thinker: turns chaos into checklists, reports, rituals, and dashboards with sound project management skills.
Solution-oriented: flexible, proactive mindset with first-principles problem-solving.
Extreme ownership: proactive, accountable, allergic to “near enough.”

Why You Will Love It Here
